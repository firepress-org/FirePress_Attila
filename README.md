## What is this?

It’s a theme (*template*) made for Ghost.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of publishing. It’s for bloggers as well as independent online publications. You can see Ghost as a better alternative to CMS systems like: *WordPress, Drupal, Medium, Tumblr*, etc.

It’s one of the most popular modern [open source projects](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) in the world, and is used in production by tens of thousands of websites and companies.


## Live demo

**Not available** at the moment. I’m working on a dedicated website where people will be able to see all Ghost Themes we are supporting at FirePress.

- [See this theme](#) on your own device.
- Even better! [Login into Ghost Admin Panel](#) and see how this theme looks with your own content.

## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

**Enhancements** — This theme is an enhanced version of the Ghost Theme **Attila**.

These are the essential enhancements I can’t live without:

- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 

(*Grid was left out as it is in conflict with the main style.css*)

**Drop-in replacement** — You can use it as a drop-in replacement of the original Casper theme.

**Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.

**Curated** — This theme is one the few themes that pass our big test. See the curated collection [in this Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).

**Compatibility** — This theme will work on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) >= **1.0**.

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is… I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
