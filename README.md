## What is this?

It’s a theme (*template*) made for Ghost.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of publishing. It’s for bloggers as well as independent online publications. You can see Ghost as a better alternative to CMS systems like: *WordPress, Drupal, Medium, Tumblr*, etc.

It’s one of the most popular modern [open source projects](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) in the world, and is used in production by tens of thousands of websites and companies.


## Live demo

**Not available** at the moment. I’m working on a dedicated website where people will be able to see all Ghost Themes we are supporting at FirePress.

- [See this theme](#) on your own device.
- Even better! [Login into Ghost Admin Panel](#) and see how this theme looks with your own content.

## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

**Enhancements** — This theme is an enhanced version of the Ghost Theme **Attila**.

These are the essential enhancements I can’t live without:

- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 

(*Grid was left out as it is in conflict with the main style.css*)

**Drop-in replacement** — You can use it as a drop-in replacement of the original Casper theme.

**Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.

**Curated** — This theme is one the few themes that pass our big test. See the curated collection [in this Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).

**Compatibility** — This theme will work on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) >= **1.0**.

## Contributing

We’d love for you to help us improve this project. To help us keep this collection high quality, we request that contributions adhere to the following guidelines.

- Explain why you’re making a change. Even if it seems self-evident, please take a sentence or two to tell us why your change or addition should happen. It’s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to everyone who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.
- Please only modify one element per pull request. This helps keep pull requests and feedback focused on a specific project or technology.

In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change you’re making, the more likely we’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.

If we choose not to include your language, tool, or project, it’s not because it’s not awesome.

1. [Fork this project][https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is… I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
